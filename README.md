## Hi, I'm Rodrigo Brasil 👋 - https://rodrigobrasil.dev.br/


I'm passionate about technology! My journey in the tech world began at the young age of 12 when I first got my hands on LUA language to edit quests of games. Since then, I have been constantly exploring this fascinating field and discovering new ways to make people's lives easier with technology.

With a degree in electrical engineering, I have a strong foundation in understanding complex problems and finding practical solutions. My engineering background has helped me develop a unique perspective when it comes to approaching and solving challenges in the tech industry.

After spending a few years working in engineering, I decided to transition my career to the world of tech, and it has been an incredibly fulfilling experience. As a dedicated developer, I am constantly seeking new ways to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology.

- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and improving my skills in various areas such as web development, software engineering, and data analysis.

- 💻 I'm experienced in using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Java, and SQL/NoSQL. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development and have experience with agile methodologies.

- 🤝 I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects and learning from others in the tech community. If you have any project ideas or want to connect, feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.

- 🎓 In addition to my degree in electrical engineering, I have also completed several courses in programming, web development, and data analysis. I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
